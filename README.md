# N_CFD Solver
N_CFD Solver is a solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics Problems using Python.
This project aims to demonstrate use of numerical methods to solve CFD problems and improve understanding of the same.

## Project structure
The project contains both an extensible Finite Difference and Finite Volume method solver at [Solver](./Solver/)
The programs in [12 steps to Navier-Stokes](./12%20steps%20to%20Navier-Stokes/) are used as introduction by the author and is based on [CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes | Lorena A. Barba group](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/)
## Reference
The project is primarily based on the authors Undergraduate Course work KTU ME322.
And the project also refers to [CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes | Lorena A. Barba group](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/)
